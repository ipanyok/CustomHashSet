# Custom hashset structure
Implemented custom structure. Its functionality is the same as in hash structures.

This structure supplies the following logic:
 - stores information of different types in buckets
 - the elements of buckets are the list structure
 - has default size of buckets, load factor
 - can add a null element such as hash structures
 - can add, delete elements such as hash structures, has "contains" and "length" methods
 - can resize depending on load factor
 - can convert elements of bucket into tree structure and backward
